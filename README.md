## Description
This is a program that models a deck of cards.  The card class initializes a
card with a suit and rank, and a deck initializes with 52 unique cards customary
with a standard deck.  The deck class also has a few methods to modify the deck:
a shuffle method to rearrage the cards in the deck, and a draw method which will
remove a certain number of cards from the top (ie position [0]) of the deck and
return an array of these cards.  This method also updates the deck's card count.
